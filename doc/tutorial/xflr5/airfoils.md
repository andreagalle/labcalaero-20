## XFoil Direct Analysis

Once you move into the `File > XFoil Direct Analysis` environment, here you can run the airfoil analysis - always remember to do that before stepping in the `Wing and Plane Design`.

Here, actually, we would have a straightforward way to directly select some standard airfoils - in particular one among the [NACA airfoils](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NACA_airfoil) collection - providing for the series of **four digits** following the word "NACA".

This numerical code contains four parameters that can be entered into equations to precisely generate the cross-section of the airfoil and calculate its properties (i.e. the maximum camber, its distance from the leading edge and the maximum thickness, everything as a fraction of the chord).

here for instance we chose - for historical reasons - the NACA 0012 airfoil that is a very simple one, being symmetrical as the leading zeros should suggest

just enter and save the airfoil, as you would have saved any other airfoil found in any database or drawn by you.
