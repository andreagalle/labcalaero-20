# Computational Aerodynamics Lab

Welcome to the Computational Aerodynamics Lab, here below you will find some useful information about the (free) Software you will need during the course, where to download it and some instruction to help you trought the preparation of the final report, to be delivered before the end of the laboratory course.

## Software download

To carry out your simulations using the Vortex Lattice Method (VLM) you will need at least one of the following solvers:

* [XFLR5](http://www.xflr5.tech/xflr5.htm) is an analysis tool for airfoils, wings and planes design at low Re - [here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/xflr5/files/) downloadable (cross-platform freeware)
* [Tornado](http://tornado.redhammer.se) is a Matlab implementation for linear aerodynamic wing design - [here](http://tornado.redhammer.se/index.php/download) downloadable (open-source code)

To post-process the output of your simulations, you may need need one of the following:

* [Excel](https://www.uniroma1.it/it/pagina/microsoft-office-studenti-e-personale-sapienza) to draw plots - from your datasets - to be included on your report
* [Matlab](https://it.mathworks.com/academia/tah-portal/sapienza-universita-di-roma-40576534.html) to draw plots - from your datasets - to be included on your report & to run Tornado **scripts**
* any other software you can download [here](https://www.uniroma1.it/it/pagina/software-gratuito) (for free) using your **uniroma1** credentials

To write your final report:

* [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com) if you want to acquaint yourself with a new & poweful editing tool (LaTex) - just play around with this [template](http://www.ingaero.uniroma1.it/attachments/079_Template_Elaborato_Finale_BAER_2019_latex.zip) 
* [Word](https://www.uniroma1.it/it/pagina/microsoft-office-studenti-e-personale-sapienza) of course is anyway a good option

## Additional material

* Airfoils database: <https://m-selig.ae.illinois.edu/ads/coord_database.html>
